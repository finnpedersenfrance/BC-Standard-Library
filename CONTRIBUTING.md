# How to contribute

The best way to contribute is to Fork this project and add more functions to the library. 

I suggest that you add a new codeunit per theme of functions. 

All functions need to have automated tests with a Code Coverage of 100%. 

Make sure that your functions
- are easy to read and understand, 
- have good names for variables, 
- are robust, 
- are easy to maintain, and
- are of general interest.
